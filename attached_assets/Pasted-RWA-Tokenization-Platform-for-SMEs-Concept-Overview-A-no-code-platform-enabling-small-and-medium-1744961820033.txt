RWA Tokenization Platform for SMEs

Concept Overview
A no-code platform enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like invoices, real estate, and equipment. The platform simplifies compliance, reduces technical barriers, and democratizes access to blockchain-based asset management.

Key Features & Differentiation
No-Code Drag-and-Drop Interface

Pre-built templates for common assets (e.g., invoices, machinery).

Step-by-step wizard for tokenization, including metadata upload and fractional ownership rules.

Regulatory Compliance Engine

Jurisdiction-specific legal templates (EU, US, Asia) auto-generated for asset contracts.

KYC/AML integration via partnerships with providers like SumSub or Onfido.

Asset-Specific Toolkits

Real Estate: Automated valuation models (AVMs) + property deed verification via Chainlink oracles.

Invoices: ERP integrations (QuickBooks, Xero) to auto-fetch and tokenize unpaid invoices.

Liquidity Marketplace

Built-in secondary marketplace for trading tokenized assets.

Liquidity pools for SMEs to earn fees by staking their asset tokens.

Dispute Resolution

Smart contracts with embedded arbitration clauses (e.g., Kleros integration).

Monetization Strategy
Tiered SaaS Pricing

Starter Tier: Free for tokenizing 1 asset/month (limited features).
Growth Tier: $99/month – 10 assets, advanced analytics.
Enterprise Tier: Custom pricing for high-volume users.

Transaction Fees

0.5% fee on secondary market trades.

1-2% fee on asset tokenization volume (e.g.,

10kinvoice→100-$200 fee).

Add-On Services

Legal advisory ($150/hour) for compliance customization.

Premium API access for accounting/fintech platforms ($500/month).

Go-to-Market Plan
Early Adoption Incentives

Partner with SME associations (e.g., U.S. Chamber of Commerce) for subsidized pilot programs.

Free workshops on "Unlocking Liquidity with Tokenization" in key markets.

Tech Stack

Blockchain: Ethereum (ERC-3643 for security tokens) + Polygon for low fees.
Storage: IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized document storage.

Competitive Edge

Unlike institutional platforms (Securitize, Polymath), focus on SMEs with:

No-code ease.

Pre-vetted legal frameworks.

ERP/accounting software integrations.

Risks & Mitigation
Regulatory Changes: Hire a legal advisory board to update templates quarterly.

Low Adoption: Offer white-glove onboarding for early users to build case studies.

Why This Works
SMEs globally own $15T in illiquid assets (World Bank), but lack tools to leverage them. By combining compliance, ease of use, and liquidity, this platform bridges a critical gap in Web3’s RWA revolution.
